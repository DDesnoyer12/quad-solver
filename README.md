# quad-solver
Quadratic Equation Solver for CIS 4900 - Senior Design
To quickly solve a problem, the program can be fed values from the command line if run in the following form:
./quad-solver {a} {b} {c}
Alternatively, just running 
./quad-solver 
with no extra arguments prompts the user to enter values manually
and allows the user to solve multiple equations before the program exits.
Additional options:
    If running from the command line, adding --log after the values will enable logging for that execution of the program:
        ./quad-solver {a} {b} {c} --log 
    If running the program normally, typing 'help' will display a list of help options, and typing 'log' will begin logging runtime events
